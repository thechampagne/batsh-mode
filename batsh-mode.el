;;;; Installation

;; You can use built-in package manager (package.el) or do everything by your hands.

;;;;; Using package manager

;; Add the following to your Emacs config file

;; (require 'package)
;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
;; (package-initialize)

;; Then use `M-x package-install RET batsh-mode RET` to install the mode.
;; Use `M-x batsh-mode` to change your current mode.

;;;;; Manual

;; Download the mode to your local directory.  You can do it through `git clone` command:

;; git clone git://github.com/thechampagne/batsh-mode.git

;; Then add path to batsh-mode to load-path list â€” add the following to your Emacs config file

;; (add-to-list 'load-path
;; 	     "/path/to/batsh-mode/")
;; (require 'batsh-mode)

;; Use `M-x batsh-mode` to change your current mode.
